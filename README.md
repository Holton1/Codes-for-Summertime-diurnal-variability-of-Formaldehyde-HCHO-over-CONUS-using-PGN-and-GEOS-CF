**Abstract**: 
Formaldehyde (HCHO) is an intermediate species produced by the photooxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and plays a major role in the hydroxyl radical (OH) budget, the production of tropospheric ozone (O3) and secondary aerosols. Understanding the diurnal cycle of HCHO can provide critical insights into tropospheric photochemistry. Here we use HCHO tropospheric column (HCHOtrop) and vertical profile retrievals from the emerging Pandonia Global Network (PGN), combined with NASA’s GEOS Composition Forecast (GEOS-CF) model (0.25°×0.25°) and the standalone GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model (0.25°×0.3125°) to better understand the diurnal variation of summertime HCHO across the contiguous US (CONUS). While PGN HCHOtrop shows a weak diurnal cycle in most regions of CONUS, a distinct bell-shaped diurnal pattern is found at the urban sites of Southern US (mainly in Houston), likely driven by highly reactive VOC emissions. GEOS-Chem shows that HCHO diurnal cycle across CONUS is primarily driven by chemical production and loss. However, GEOS-CF shows an excessively uniform HCHO vertical shape within the planetary boundary layer (PBL), while PGN shows a significant decrease in HCHO concentrations in 0.5 – 2 km above surface. The model bias in HCHO profile leads to an overestimation of modelled HCHOtrop in Northeast Coastal US and Southeast US, possibly driven by inaccuracies in PBL mixing, VOC emissions and photochemistry representation within GEOS-CF. These findings offer valuable insights for interpreting HCHO observations from geostationary satellites and understanding model biases in surface O3.
